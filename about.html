        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
          I’m <strong>Elisan</strong>, formerly known as Nerubucha Elishamah, an Automotive
          Engineer with a growing focus on software engineering, robotics, and artificial intelligence.My background in mechanical systems has shaped a strong analytical mindset,
          which I now apply to building reliable and efficient software solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
          I aspire to become a versatile software engineer capable of designing intelligent
          systems, automation tools, and digital platforms that solve real-world problems.
          My long-term goal is to bridge engineering and technology by integrating
          hardware intelligence with robust, user-focused software.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond academics, I’m driven by curiosity, discipline, and continuous learning.
          I believe in mastering fundamentals, building practical projects, and growing
          through consistent execution—not shortcuts.
